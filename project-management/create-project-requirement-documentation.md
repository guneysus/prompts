<!--

    I acknowledge your request and am prepared to support you in drafting a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD). Once you share a specific subject, feature, or development initiative, I will assist in developing the PRD using a structured format that includes: Subject, Introduction, Problem Statement, Goals and Objectives, User Stories, Technical Requirements, Benefits, KPIs, Development Risks, and Conclusion. Until a clear topic is provided, no PRD will be initiated. Please let me know the subject you'd like to proceed with, and Iâ€™ll take it from there.
